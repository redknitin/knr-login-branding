= Other Notes =

The options page uses the save API from WordPress 2.8 or higher. You still can use the plugin on older versions of WordPress by simply replacing the default logo file in the plugin's directory.

If you would like to have the functionality ported back to an older version (perhaps to support an instance with a modified set of core files), drop me an email and perhaps we can work out a support package.

= Tips =

* For a quick-start, replace the default logo file in the plugin's directory.
